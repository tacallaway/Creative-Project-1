    <h2>&mdash;Submitted by Anne Carlson</h2>
    <p>My 16-year-old brother, Ryan, was out late with friends one night. Suddenly he realized it was Fatherâ€™s Day and he had neglected to buy a card for our dad. After much searching, Ryan located an open store, but was disappointed to find only two cards left on a picked-over rack. Selecting one, he brought it home and, somewhat sheepishly, presented it to our father. </p>
    <p>Upon opening it, Dad read this message: &quot;You&apos;ve been like a father to me.&quot; He looked at Ryan, puzzled.</p>
    <p>&quot;Well, Dad,&quot; Ryan tried to explain, &quot;it was either that or the card that said, &apos;Now that I&apos;m a father too!&apos;&quot;</p>

    <h2>&mdash;Submitted by Ann Darbyshire</h2>
    <p>My dad, George, was born into a large family in Ireland and together with many of his siblings, he only had a casual relationship with spelling. He turned to Scrabble as a means of improving this, which became necessary for writing reports in a job in Western Australia where our family had emigrated. He became a keen and competitive player. However, his spelling still occasionally let him down.</p>
    <p>With great confidence he would plop down a word that bore no resemblance to anything in English. We would remonstrate with him: &quotThat's not a word,&quot we chorused. Undeterred he would respond, &quotWell, it should be!&quot</p>
